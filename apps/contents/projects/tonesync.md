ToneSync is a specialized utility designed to solve common webcam quality issues on Hackintosh systems. It provides fine-tuned control over webcam parameters to achieve professional-quality video with accurate color reproduction, particularly for skin tones.

## Overview

Hackintosh users often face webcam color processing issues that result in poor video quality during video calls and recordings. ToneSync addresses these problems by:

- Bypassing macOS's default webcam color processing pipeline
- Directly controlling USB webcam parameters at the hardware level
- Implementing custom color optimization algorithms specifically tuned for natural skin tones
- Providing consistent settings that work across different video applications

## Key Features

- **Direct Hardware Control**: Communicates directly with webcam hardware to adjust parameters not accessible through standard macOS interfaces
- **Smart Color Optimization**: Automatically detects and enhances skin tones for more natural appearance
- **Persistent Settings**: Maintains your preferred settings across system reboots and application changes
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Quick access to controls without interrupting your workflow
- **Low Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint

## Quick Start

1. Install ToneSync from the releases page
2. Grant camera and USB device permissions when prompted
3. Click the menu bar icon to access controls
4. Use keyboard shortcuts for common actions:
   - ⌘O: Optimize camera
   - ⌘R: Reset camera
   - ⌘,: Preferences
   - ⌘Q: Quit

## Requirements & Compatibility

- macOS 11.0 - 14.x with OpenCore bootloader
- Compatible webcams:
  - Logitech (C920, C922, C930e, BRIO)
  - Generic USB webcams with UVC support
- Camera and USB permissions must be granted

## Technical Implementation

ToneSync is built with Swift and leverages several low-level frameworks:

- **IOKit**: For direct USB device communication
- **AVFoundation**: For camera capture and preview
- **Core Image**: For custom color processing filters
- **AppKit**: For the native macOS user interface

The application uses a modular architecture that separates device communication, color processing, and user interface components, making it easy to add support for additional webcam models.

## Privacy

ToneSync operates entirely locally on your machine:
- No data is sent to external servers
- No analytics or telemetry
- No internet connection required

## Development

This project is open source and contributions are welcome. The codebase is structured to make it easy to add support for additional webcam models and color processing algorithms.
